Using HTML, CSS and React, this app allows visitors to create an account in order to log their recipes and search up nutrition info about food (powered by CalorieNinjas API). Account users can share their recipes for visitors without an account to view the shared recipes. This app was also developed using Vite to easily set up the app. This app was deployed using Github Pages (https://gitsheils.github.io/final_frontend/).

Future improvements to this app may include a like feature and review feature for the shared recipes, so that account users can see what others think about their recipes and visitors can see which recipes are rated well.
