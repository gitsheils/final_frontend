        About the author of Recipe WebBook: I am an aspiring software engineer.
        I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js, thanks to
        my studies at TripleTen. Down the line I hope to create websites for
        restaurants so people can easily check out their menus. I would also
        like to build educational websites.
